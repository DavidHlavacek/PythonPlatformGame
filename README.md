# üéÆ Savana Rumble
A small platform game made in Python

Hey guys! Thank you for checking out my platform game. This was a project I created when I was 13 years old. While the optimization might not be the best, I have plans to improve it in the future. Enjoy playing!

- **Platform Mechanics**: Classic platform game with jumping, moving, and avoiding obstacles.
- **Basic Enemies**: Avoid comets, bullets, and spikes coming from the ground.
- **Pixel-Perfect Collision**: Experience precise collision detection for a smooth gameplay experience.
- **Parabolic/Physics-Perfect Jump**: Realistic jumping mechanics to enhance the platforming challenge.
- **Sprite Animation**: Animated sprites for more lively and engaging visuals.
- **Randomized Gameplay**: Each run is different, providing unique challenges and experiences.
