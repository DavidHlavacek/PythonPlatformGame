# üéÆ PythonPlatformGame
A small platform game made in Python

Hey guys! Thank you for checking out my platform game. This was a project I created when I was 13 years old. While the optimization might not be the best, I have plans to improve it in the future. Enjoy playing!

## Features üåü
- **Platform Mechanics**: Classic platform game with jumping, moving, and avoiding obstacles.
- **Basic Enemies**: Avoid comets, bullets, and spikes coming from the ground.
- **Pixel-Perfect Collision**: Experience precise collision detection for a smooth gameplay experience.
- **Parabolic/Physics-Perfect Jump**: Realistic jumping mechanics to enhance the platforming challenge.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your survival time and aim for a high score.

## Prerequisites üìã
Before running the Python platform game, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
1. **Python 3.x**:
   
   - Install Python to run the game.
   - **Download Link**: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   
3. **Pygame**:
   
   - Install the Pygame library for handling game development tasks.
   - Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
  
     ```
     pip install pygame
     ```

## Setup and Running üõ†Ô∏è
1. Clone the repository
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where "Version5.py" is located.
5. Run the game using the following command:
   
    ```
    python Version5.py
    ```

## How to Play üéÆ
1. **Move Left**: Press `A` key
2. **Move Right**: Press `D` key
