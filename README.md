# PythonPlatformGame
A small platform game I made in Python

Hey guys! Thank you for checking out my platform game.

First of all, I was 13 at the time, the optimization is really poor, all of it is in one py file... Sooo yeah... 
I will optimize it and convert it into an .exe file when I have time.

Second of all, put the folder images in the same repository as the Version5.py !!

Third of all, when I have time I will add some features like highscore, pause, super powers, etc... and I'll eventually update it.

Have fun !
